In the digital age, video content on platforms like YouTube has become an integral source of information.
However, the sheer volume and length of video transcripts pose challenges for efficient information retrieval. This 
project introduces a solution, the YouTube Video Transcript Summarizer, aimed at streamlining the extraction 
of valuable insights from videos. Leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques, Speech-to-Text 
capabilities, and Large Language Models (LLM), our system condenses lengthy video transcripts into concise and 
informative summaries. Furthermore, it incorporates a multi-lingual question-answering bot functionality to enhance the 
accessibility of specific content. The scope of this paper encompasses demonstrating the potential benefits of such 
a system to a diverse range of users, from content creators to researchers and language learners. By making video 
content more accessible and manageable, the YouTube Video Transcript Summarizer addresses the growing need 
for efficient information retrieval from multimedia sources in the digital era.
